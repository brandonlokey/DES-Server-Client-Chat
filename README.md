===== DES CHAT SERVER/CLIENT SOCKET APPLICATION ===== 

Function: Utilize DES encryption in socket server/client chat application in which the server and client take turns
 talking to each other.
 
 Languages/Libraries: I used Java to program the application. For the libraries, I primarily used Java's socket
  libraries for the server and Java's crypto and security libraries for the encryption and key handling.
  
  IDE Used: IntelliJ
  
  How To Run: Run the Server application first and then run the Client one next. The console will let you know when
   you have established a connection and then the server and client should be able to take turns communicating with
